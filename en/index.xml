      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GitLens on VS Code since always! The reason I Installed GitLens is being one of the most popular and recommended extensions on the marketplace. But recently I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how its current line blame feature has made my whole committing process much better.
Of course, I knew about Git blame long before even GitLens came into existence. Although it&amp;rsquo;s a great tool to exploit git history, It&amp;rsquo;s not handy and easy to use and so it&amp;rsquo;s not commonly used.</description>

      <description>I guess you know my name by now. I started playing with code when I was 10 and I&amp;rsquo;ve been enchanted with software since then.
I am super-passionate about software architecture, leadership and startups. I spend a lot of time on reading books and articles, watching tech talks and experimenting on these subjects.
In my spare time, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly building software and contributing to open source softwares. I like to watch movies and series a lot.</description>

      <description>As long as I remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed blogging and wanted to do it more. But unfortunately, it never happened. Recently, I came to realize that the high standards I had for the quality of my posts were possibly the most important reason not to write. Basically, I had always wanted a professional blog! By professional, I mean a blog which the author makes a living out it; and maybe some other people as well!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we want to store &lt;code&gt;Gender&lt;/code&gt; as an attribute for our users.
And since we use PostgreSQL we can define an enum for gender like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was following an instruction to deploy an application on a Virtualbox VM and I wanted to execute the long commands. By default it’s not possible to copy those command into the VM. VirtualBox has a shared clipboard feature which I tried to get it working but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen so I didn’t dig into it and I came up with a funny hack :D I sent the commands through a socket :)</description>

      <description>Let me introduce TehPUG. TehPUG is the Tehran Python Users Group like any other PUG around the world. People who love python or have heard it recently and want to learn more about it. We have meetups every month. Come and join us if you love python too.
A little background I was new to python when I joined TehPUG in its early days. There were people who helped me learn more about python and even give me a chance to do some practical stuffs.</description>

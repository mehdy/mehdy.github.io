      <description>&lt;p&gt;As long as I remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed blogging and wanted to do it more. But unfortunately, it never happened.
Recently, I came to realize that the high standards I had for the quality of my posts were possibly the most important reason not to write.
Basically, I had always wanted a professional blog! By professional, I mean a blog which the author makes a living out it; and maybe some other people as well! And the effort I was willing to make was just a little bit more than tweeting!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

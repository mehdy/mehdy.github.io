      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today when I was riding the bus I thought &amp;ldquo;would it be possible to efficiently utilize the seats so that each individual would sit as long as possible?&amp;rdquo;. The short answer is for reality is probably &amp;ldquo;NO!&amp;rdquo; but let&amp;rsquo;s have fun with the problem in theory at least :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that we have a bus route with 50 stops and the distance between each consecutive pair is constant. The bus has 20 seats (Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on one bus for now). Then at each stop (including the terminals) we get the data on how many people are getting on and at which stop they&amp;rsquo;re getting off. At each stop tell each passenger to sit (optionally) or let them stay standing by default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

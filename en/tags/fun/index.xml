      <title>Can You Solve This?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today when I was riding the bus I thought &amp;ldquo;would it be possible to efficiently utilize the seats so that each individual would sit as long as possible?&amp;rdquo;. The short answer is for reality is probably &amp;ldquo;NO!&amp;rdquo; but let&amp;rsquo;s have fun with the problem in theory at least :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that we have a bus route with 50 stops and the distance between each consecutive pair is constant. The bus has 20 seats (Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on one bus for now). Then at each stop (including the terminals) we get the data on how many people are getting on and at which stop they&amp;rsquo;re getting off. At each stop tell each passenger to sit (optionally) or let them stay standing by default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As long as I remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed blogging and wanted to do it more. But unfortunately, it never happened.
Recently, I came to realize that the high standards I had for the quality of my posts were possibly the most important reason not to write.
Basically, I had always wanted a professional blog! By professional, I mean a blog which the author makes a living out it; and maybe some other people as well! And the effort I was willing to make was just a little bit more than tweeting!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was following an instruction to deploy an application on a Virtualbox VM and I wanted to execute the long commands. By default it’s not possible to copy those command into the VM. VirtualBox has a shared clipboard feature which I tried to get it working but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen so I didn’t dig into it and I came up with a funny hack :D
I sent the commands through a socket :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

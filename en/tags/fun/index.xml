      <description>As long as I remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed blogging and wanted to do it more. But unfortunately, it never happened. Recently, I came to realize that the high standards I had for the quality of my posts were possibly the most important reason not to write. Basically, I had always wanted a professional blog! By professional, I mean a blog which the author makes a living out it; and maybe some other people as well!</description>

      <description>I was following an instruction to deploy an application on a Virtualbox VM and I wanted to execute the long commands. By default it’s not possible to copy those command into the VM. VirtualBox has a shared clipboard feature which I tried to get it working but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen so I didn’t dig into it and I came up with a funny hack :D I sent the commands through a socket :)</description>

      <description>Today when I was riding the bus I thought &amp;ldquo;would it be possible to efficiently utilize the seats so that each individual would sit as long as possible?&amp;rdquo;. The short answer is for reality is probably &amp;ldquo;NO!&amp;rdquo; but let&amp;rsquo;s have fun with the problem in theory at least :)
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that we have a bus route with 50 stops and the distance between each consecutive pair is constant. The bus has 20 seats (Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on one bus for now).</description>

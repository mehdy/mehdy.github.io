      <description>Battlefield is a project that I&amp;rsquo;ve started in TehPUG. you can read the story behind it and see how I decided to start this project here.
So far till now I experienced some projects and activities that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out as I expected. I asked my self what are the requirements to activate and motivate TehPUG. I came up with a few answers&amp;hellip;
 It should be suitable for everyone. from the very beginner that learned something about python today to the python expert.</description>

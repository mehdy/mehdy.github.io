      <description>I guess you know my name by now. I started playing with code when I was 10 and I&amp;rsquo;ve been enchanted with software since then.
I am super-passionate about software engineering, startups and leadership. I spend a lot of time on reading books and articles, watching tech talks and experimenting on these subjects.
In my spare time, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly building software and contributing to open source softwares. I like to watch movies and series a lot.</description>
